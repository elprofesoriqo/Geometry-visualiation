# Geometry Analysis Tasks

This project is a graphical application developed in Python using Tkinter that allows users to solve basic geometric problems. The application provides two main functionalities: checking if a point belongs to a circle and checking if a point lies on a line.

## Features

- **Circle Check**: 
  - Enter the center of the circle as coordinates (x,y).
  - Specify the radius.
  - Input the coordinates of the point to check if it lies within the circle.
  
- **Line Check**:
  - Define a line using the general form \( Ax + By + C = 0 \).
  - Input the coordinates of the point to verify if it lies on the line.
  - Visualize the line and the point on a graph using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To run this project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
